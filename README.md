# MATLAB-DSP

This repository contains code and resources from my Software Applications course. The course focused on MATLAB (with Octave being used due to pricing, though it is functionally the same) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) concepts.

## About

The course covered fundamental topics in Digital Signal Processing, and the repository includes several exercises and examples demonstrating key DSP concepts and their implementation in MATLAB.

## Files Included

The repository contains various MATLAB script files, each corresponding to different exercises or examples discussed in the course. Some of the key files are:

- `Anthony_Sevarino_1.m`
- `Anthony_Sevarino_2.m`
- `Anthony_Sevarino_Ex1-4.m`
- `Anthony_Sevarino_Ex14.m`
- `Anthony_Sevarino_Ex15.m`
- And many others...

Each file corresponds to specific lessons or exercises related to DSP.

## Usage

1. Ensure that MATLAB or Octave is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the MATLAB or Octave terminal and run any of the `.m` files to explore the DSP examples.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Antsevs/MATLAB-DSP.git
cd MATLAB-DSP
